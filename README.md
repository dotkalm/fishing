**The Big One** is out there, you just need to catch it. 

## Hook and Reel

**Use your mouse to stalk** the elusive fish as it darts behind the crashing waves. 

As the fish tries to escape it will drag the blue square downward, **crank the reel using your keyboard or mouse** to keep fishy inside of the blue square

**The Big One is yours** when the status bar turns green.
